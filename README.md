# UnderSheet 🗂️

**Persistent thread memory for OpenClaw agents. Works everywhere.**

Zero dependencies. Pure Python stdlib. One file to rule them all.

---

## The Problem

Your agent wakes up every 30 minutes. It sees 40 posts. It has no idea which ones it already read, which threads it was part of, or what changed since it last looked. So it either re-reads everything or ignores everything.

This is the session amnesia problem. Every agent hits it.

## The Solution

UnderSheet tracks your threads across heartbeats — on any platform.

```
$ python3 undersheet.py heartbeat --platform hackernews

[undersheet:hackernews] heartbeat @ 09:01 UTC

Your agent picks up exactly where it left off. Every platform. Every heartbeat.

## Install

```bash
# Core engine
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubgb/undersheet/main/undersheet.py \
  -o ~/.openclaw/skills/undersheet/undersheet.py

# Platform adapters (grab what you need)
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills/undersheet/platforms
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubgb/undersheet/main/platforms/moltbook.py \
  -o ~/.openclaw/skills/undersheet/platforms/moltbook.py
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubgb/undersheet/main/platforms/hackernews.py \
  -o ~/.openclaw/skills/undersheet/platforms/hackernews.py
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubgb/undersheet/main/platforms/reddit.py \
  -o ~/.openclaw/skills/undersheet/platforms/reddit.py
```

Or via ClawHub:
```bash
clawhub install undersheet
```

> **Twitter/X adapter:** also grab `platforms/twitter.py`
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubgb/undersheet/main/platforms/twitter.py \
>   -o ~/.openclaw/skills/undersheet/platforms/twitter.py
> ```

## Quick Start

**1. Configure a platform:**
```bash
# Hacker News (no auth needed for read-only)
echo '{"username": "myuser", "password": "mypass"}' \
  > ~/.config/undersheet/hackernews.json
```

**2. Run a heartbeat:**
```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/undersheet/undersheet.py heartbeat --platform hackernews
```

**3. Track a specific thread:**
```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/undersheet/undersheet.py track \
  --platform hackernews --thread-id 47147183
```

**4. Add to HEARTBEAT.md:**
```markdown
## UnderSheet (every 30 minutes)
Run: python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/undersheet/undersheet.py heartbeat --platform hackernews
```

---

## Commands

```
heartbeat   Check tracked threads + new feed posts
feed-new    Show only unseen posts from the feed
track       Start tracking a thread by ID
unread      List threads with new replies (no feed)
status      Overview of tracked threads + last run
platforms   List installed platform adapters
```

## Proxy Support

Route agent traffic through a proxy without changing your system settings.

```bash
# Config file (persists across runs)
echo '{"http": "http://yourproxy:8080"}' > ~/.config/undersheet/proxy.json

# SOCKS5 (SSH tunnel, Tor — needs: pip install pysocks)
echo '{"socks5": "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"}' > ~/.config/undersheet/proxy.json

# Per-command override
python3 undersheet.py heartbeat --platform reddit --proxy http://yourproxy:8080

# Env vars work too
ALL_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 python3 undersheet.py heartbeat --platform hackernews
```

**System VPNs (Mullvad, WireGuard, ProtonVPN):** no config needed — they route all traffic automatically.

## Adding a Platform

Drop a file in `platforms/` with a class named `Adapter`:

```python
from undersheet import PlatformAdapter

class Adapter(PlatformAdapter):
    name = "myplatform"

    def get_threads(self, thread_ids: list) -> list:
        # Return: [{"id", "title", "url", "comment_count", "score"}, ...]
        ...

    def get_feed(self, limit=25, **kwargs) -> list:
        # Return: [{"id", "title", "url", "score", "created_at"}, ...]
        ...

    def post_comment(self, thread_id: str, content: str, **kwargs) -> dict:
        # Return: {"success": True} or {"error": "..."}
        ...
```

Run `undersheet.py platforms` to confirm it's detected.

---

## State

State is stored per-platform at `~/.config/undersheet/<platform>_state.json`. Safe to inspect, edit, or back up.

## Relationship to MoltMemory

UnderSheet is the generalized successor to [MoltMemory](https://github.com/ubgb/moltmemory). MoltMemory is Moltbook-specific and stays maintained. UnderSheet brings the same architecture to every platform.
